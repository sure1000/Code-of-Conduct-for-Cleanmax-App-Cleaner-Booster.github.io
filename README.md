Code of Conduct
Effective Date: July 25, 2025

As the creator and maintainer of this website and associated projects, I am committed to fostering a positive, respectful, and harassment-free environment for everyone who interacts with my work or with me directly. This Code of Conduct outlines my expectations for behaviour and my pledge to uphold these standards.

This applies to interactions related to this website, my open-source projects, communications via email, and any other spaces where I represent myself professionally.


My Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, I pledge to ensure that all interactions are free of harassment, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

I pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy professional environment.


My Standards

Examples of behaviour that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

•	Using welcoming and inclusive language.

•	Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.

•	Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.

•	Referring to people by their preferred pronouns and using gender-neutral pronouns when uncertain.

•	Showing empathy towards others.


Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

•	Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, public or private harassment.

•	Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission (doxing).

•	Not respecting reasonable communication boundaries (e.g., continued contact after being asked to stop).

•	The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.

•	Swearing or the use of strong, offensive, or disturbing language in an inappropriate context.

•	Promoting or demonstrating content known to be illegal, hateful, or deeply disturbing without appropriate warnings or context.

•	Engaging in hostile political arguments that are off-topic and detract from a constructive environment.

•	Assuming or promoting any form of inequality.

•	Attacking personal tastes in a derogatory manner.

•	Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or respectful public setting.


Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all interactions related to this website, my projects, and my professional online presence. This includes, but is not limited to:


•	Comments on blog posts (if applicable).

•	Communication via email (e.g., to cleanmax.contact@riswebs.com ).

•	Interactions on social media platforms where I represent my work.

•	Contributions to or discussions about my open-source projects on platforms like GitHub.


It also applies when I am officially representing myself or my projects in public spaces, whether online or offline.


Enforcement & Reporting

I am responsible for clarifying and enforcing the standards of acceptable behaviour and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour that I deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by contacting me at cleanmax.contact@riswebs.com. All reports will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. This may include warnings, blocking from communication channels, or other actions as outlined below.

I hold the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviours that I deem inappropriate.


Enforcement Guidelines

I will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action deemed in violation of this Code of Conduct:


1. Correction

Community Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behaviour deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.

Consequence: A private, written communication explaining the nature of the violation and why the behaviour was inappropriate. An apology may be requested.


2. Warning

Community Impact: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behaviour. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent restriction from interaction.


3. Temporary Restriction

Community Impact: A serious violation of standards, including sustained inappropriate behaviour.

Consequence: A temporary restriction from any sort of interaction or public communication for a specified period. No public or private interaction with the people involved is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent restriction.

Consequence: A permanent restriction from any sort of public interaction related to my work or projects.
